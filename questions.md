# Ask Better Questions

Questions are powerful when you are curious. Questions are to discover. Not to influence.

> The older I get, the more time I spend—as a percentage of each day—on crafting better questions.
> In my experience, going from 1x to 10x, from 10x to 100x, and from 100x to (when Lady Luck really
> smiles) 1000x returns in various areas has been a product of better questions.

Drive more questions. It's under-used. Create a culture of curiosity.
Questioning defines and structures what we don’t know.
