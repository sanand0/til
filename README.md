# Things I learned

This repo publishes my notes / learnings on Sundays at [til.s-anand.net](https://til.s-anand.net).

The [live branch](https://github.com/sanand0/til/tree/live) is updated real-time via the [GitDoc VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.gitdoc).

## Notes files

Updated daily / weekly:

- `llms.md`: Notes about LLMs
- `til.md`: Other things I've learned
- `apps.md`: Apps I plan to build
- `trending-repos.tsv`: Weekly trending GitHub repos (updated by [trending-repos.sh](trending-repos.sh))

Updated monthly / quarterly:

- `claude-code-uses.md`: How Anthropic teams use Claude Code

Notes structure:

- **Notes format:** Top-level bullets only in the pattern `- DD Mon YYYY` (e.g., `- 3 Dec 2023`), with sub-bullets **indented by two spaces**. Only those lines are "notes". Rest are ignored.
- **Hierarchy:** Only lines indented by **two spaces** under a date line are part of that note.
- **Tags:** Inline `#tags` inside note text + embedding-based topic assignment.
- **README.md is excluded** from note ingestion; other `*.md` are included.

## Code

Requires Deno 1.x, git, Node (for Prettier), OpenAI API access.

- `update.sh`: A shell script that copies the notes from Dropbox to the repo and commits them.
- `convert.js`: Deno script converts Markdown notes into HTML site + RSS feed under `public/`
  - Generates `public/yyyy-mm-dd.html` with contents from week ending Saturday midnight IST. Excludes ongoing week.
  - Generates `public/tag.html` for each tag.
  - Generates `public/feed.xml` RSS feed.
  - Tags each note using similarity > 0.3 via `text-embedding-3-small`. Supports `OPENAI_BASE_URL` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: Publishes `public/` via GitHub Pages on `main`.

To publish, run:

```bash
# Lint Markdown & build site (writes to public/)
OPENAI_API_KEY=... deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env --allow-net convert.js

# Convenience script also lints, builds, and commits
OPENAI_API_KEY=... bash update.sh
```
