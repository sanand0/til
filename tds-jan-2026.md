# TDS Jan 2026

Random ideas for the TDS Jan 2026 course iteration, collected Dec 2025.

- TDS. https://chatgpt.com/c/693a9ab6-2cb8-8330-9327-97c890be0e65
  - Add Instructor insight pages (on teamwork, localizing data, misconceptions about storytelling) are basically meta-pedagogy docs you could adapt as pre-reads for TAs or co-instructors.
  - Assignments force students to build a small dataset from their own campus lives (e.g. drinking fountains, sunny days) plus write full documentation and reflections on what that reveals.
  - “Data visceralization”: students must invent a physical or otherwise visceral representation of their data – very stealable for geospatial, networks, or RAG explanations.
  - debugging/profiling → metaprogramming → security
  - test with bash in browser!
  - rewrite course in your style and update
  - Course synchronized with a live conference: students attend / intersect with the Cooperative AI Conference, with conference participants appearing as guest speakers. That’s a powerful pattern for you: run a TDS “conference-shadow” module keyed to PyCon, data science meetups, or your own AI clinics.

  - Strang "acts like a student himself encountering it for the first time." Add a Simplicio style FAQ to each question! Concrete mathematics style asides. Share failure stories and bloopers.
  - Use constant, low-stakes questioning to keep attention. Click to reveal answer to non evaluated, simple, questions. Use xkcd style titles
  - Add a termwise changelog at the top of each README.
  - Write JS code to draw histogram. LLM vision verification.
