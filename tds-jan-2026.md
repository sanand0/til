# TDS Jan 2026

## Ideas

Random ideas for the TDS Jan 2026 course iteration, collected Dec 2025.

- TDS. https://chatgpt.com/c/693a9ab6-2cb8-8330-9327-97c890be0e65
  - Add Instructor insight pages (on teamwork, localizing data, misconceptions about storytelling) are basically meta-pedagogy docs you could adapt as pre-reads for TAs or co-instructors.
  - Assignments force students to build a small dataset from their own campus lives (e.g. drinking fountains, sunny days) plus write full documentation and reflections on what that reveals.
  - “Data visceralization”: students must invent a physical or otherwise visceral representation of their data – very stealable for geospatial, networks, or RAG explanations.
  - debugging/profiling → metaprogramming → security
  - Test with bash in browser!
  - Rewrite course in your style and update
  - Course synchronized with a live conference: students attend / intersect with the Cooperative AI Conference, with conference participants appearing as guest speakers. That’s a powerful pattern for you: run a TDS “conference-shadow” module keyed to PyCon, data science meetups, or your own AI clinics.
  - Share prompts rather than content. Suggest styles to write, points to learn, questions or alternative tools to evaluate and compare, etc. E.g. When would I use Cloudflare and not AWS? Which is easier to learn?
- TDS Strand. https://chatgpt.com/c/683bfefd-7100-800c-95e4-0780b3f4c2f5
  - Teach intuition via GAs.
  - ⭐ The GAs are your blog and podcast and video!! Connect theory to real-world applications from day one. Live code solution scaffolding! Embed the question in AV!
  - Strang "acts like a student himself encountering it for the first time." Add a Simplicio style FAQ to each question! Concrete mathematics style asides. Share failure stories and bloopers.
  - Use constant, low-stakes questioning to keep attention. Click to reveal answer to non evaluated, simple, questions. Use xkcd style titles
  - Add a termwise changelog at the top of each README.
  - Write JS code to draw histogram. LLM vision verification.
  - Code understanding from a public repo. Find the line that does X.
  - Win board game.
  - You have the answer to another student's question: email SHA. Another email SHA has yours.
  - ⭐ TDS. Run playwright script in students machine. Test their personalized app. Crypto secure.
  - Incorporate logging & observability in the curriculum.
  - Incorporate robustness, reliability, try except, etc.
- TDS Jan 2026 ideas, Dec 2025
  - Convince a virtual agent to give you extra marks.
  - Have students create content. Most valuable addition gets marks.
  - ⭐ LLM continuous evaluation of the niceness of Discourse posts - social policing score. Helpfulness, etc.
  - Bootcamp: Basic Linux command, FastApi + httpx, Git, Docker/Podman, Basic App HuggingFace Deployment
- Bonus Mark: Get a PR solving an existing issue accepted by any open source data science repo with 1,000+ stars?
