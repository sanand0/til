# AI Capabilities

AI/LLM capabilities / trends.

- Swarms. Ask AI for dozens of solutions in parallel. Merge, rank, auto-debate, converge.
- Personalize at Scale. Have AI create feedback, designs, excerpts/summaries, ... tailored to EACH person at scale.
- Computer use. Agents can operate UIs like a human (browser, apps).
- LLM-as-a-judge. Use AI to validate ever-increasing AI generated output.
- Synthetic data. Have AI create realistic data for prototypes, testing edge cases, market research simulation, training data, ...
- Code on demand. Ask AI for outcomes directly. Agents code _on the fly_ to get there, in data science, research, management, ...
- Style transfer. Have AI a master's style of drawing, coding, writing, ... creating an army of their apprentices.
- Multi-modality. Use AI's native voice/video/screensharing and long-context perception.
- Citizen experts. Non-expertise is not a barrier. AI lets amateurs create expert-level films, music, software, reports, ...
- Long-context LLMs. Growing LLM context size lets us process entire repos, legal libraries, personal lifelogs, ...
- Memory. AI assistants learn per-person / per-team. Cuts prompt engineering, builds knowledge.
- Agent-to-Agent. Agents consuming content (e.g. `llms.txt`), agents calling agents (sub-agents, A2A protocol, ...)
- Real-world tools. Have AI write reports, send emails, shop online, use computer, control devices, ...
- Jagged frontier. AI is great at certain things but terrible at others. This frontier is unknown and shifting rapidly.
- Lethal trifecta. You can only have 2 out of these 3: private data, untrusted content, and external communication.
- Edge/Private AI. Small models on private cloud compute.
- Authenticity. What content is authentic? What's slop? What's fraud? Are AI twins liable?
- AI Governance. Strict liability, transparency mandates, state control, ...

To be evaluated:

- Data / workflow as the moat
- AI native business models
- AI digital-divide
