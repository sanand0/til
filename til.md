# Things I learned

## Dec 2024

- 27 Dec 2024. What would be the cost of storing about 500GB of LLM cache logs and 5 million requests per month?

  - CloudFlare R2: $7.5 / month [Ref](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/pricing/) +
- 25 Dec 2024. Browsers support SVG favicons as data URLs. So I used this SVG (generated by Claude via `Generate a simple, interesting SVG favicon. Keep the SVG size VERY small but it should be inspiring.`)

  ```svg
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 32 32">
    <!-- Background circle -->
    <circle cx="16" cy="16" r="15" fill="#2563eb"/>

    <!-- Stylized star/spark shape -->
    <path d="M16 7 L18 14 L25 16 L18 18 L16 25 L14 18 L7 16 L14 14 Z" fill="white"/>

    <!-- Inner glow/highlight -->
    <circle cx="13" cy="13" r="2" fill="#93c5fd" opacity="0.6"/>
  </svg>
  ```

  and modified it a bit into this:

  <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 32 32" width="32" height="32">
    <circle cx="16" cy="16" r="15" fill="#2563eb"/>
    <path fill="#fff" d="m16 7 2 7 7 2-7 2-2 7-2-7-7-2 7-2Z"/>
  </svg>

  ... which and then compressed it (via [svgomg](https://svgomg.net/)) into a data URL included like this:

  ```html
  <link
    rel="icon"
    type="image/svg+xml"
    href="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAzMiAzMiI+PGNpcmNsZSBjeD0iMTYiIGN5PSIxNiIgcj0iMTUiIGZpbGw9IiMyNTYzZWIiLz48cGF0aCBmaWxsPSIjZmZmIiBkPSJtMTYgNyAyIDcgNyAyLTcgMi0yIDctMi03LTctMiA3LTJaIi8+PC9zdmc+"

- 23 Dec 2024. CloudFlare has multiple [SSL modes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/) when proxying requests.
  - [Off (no encryption)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/off/): No encryption between browsers and Cloudflare or between Cloudflare and origins. Everything is cleartext HTTP.
  - [Flexible](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/flexible/): Browsers to Cloudflare is HTTPS, Cloudflare to origin is HTTP. Useful to set up CloudFlare as a HTTP Proxy.
  - [Full](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full/): Browser to Cloudflare matches browser request. Same protocol is used for Cloudflare to origin, without validating the origin’s certificate. Use for self-signed or otherwise invalid certificates.
  - [Full (strict)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full-strict/): Similar to Full Mode, but with validation.
  - [Strict (SSL-Only Origin Pull)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/ssl-only-origin-pull/): Cloudflare always connects to the origin over HTTPS with certificate validation.
  - Getting this wrong can lead to a [HTTP 526: invalid SSL certificate](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/troubleshooting/cloudflare-errors/troubleshooting-cloudflare-5xx-errors/#error-526-invalid-ssl-certificate)

  - Licensing their content. (Meta says high quality content improves LLM performance by 30% on HumanEval)
  - Enterprise StackOverflow for system integration
  - Fine-tuned versions of Enterprise Stackoverflow for enterprises
  - Integrate StackOverflow within your IDE. Ask questions, post directly

The only programmatic way to add users is for an administrator to add them. Even apps that use the Google Admin SDK need an admin to log in to access the relevant API.
- 04 Dec 2024. Take 100% of your work, including complex, multi step processes and put it into an LLM. It might fail at some but you will discover the limitations.
- 04 Dec 2024. I emailed Straive employees about their use of [LLM Foundry](https://llmfoundry.straive.com/) - the internal LLM portal. I picked ~500 non-users from teams that _otherwise_ have high (30%+) usage.
  - Reasons they didn't use it were:
    - 40% had not heard of it.
    - 40% were unclear of the benefits
    - 20% didn't have time
  - 45% feel they don't have enough information and training to use it
  - Some feedback
    - Sharing training videos will help
    - Live training sessions that allows for Q&A will help
    - Developers prefer detailed documentation
    - The same prompt gives different results
  - Possible solution: Email non-users introducing the tool and sharing a quick 15-minute tutorial and a 1-page quick start.
- 03 Dec 2024. DuckDB's JavaScript API is still under development. For example, [JSON, ARRAY are not insertable](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-node-neo/blob/cb5be3d27b8aedfac7f2c9d0eec360891fb9e1f7/api/src/DuckDBAppender.ts). Plus, re-creating persistent HNSW indices crashes.

## Nov 2024

- 29 Nov 2024. Gists are a good place to store static files for posterity as well as throwaway files. But, they're just git repositories. So there may be no advantage over GitHub repos.
- 28 Nov 2024. HTMX focuses on HTML over JS. Like server responses being HTML snippets not JSON. But I need front-end over back-end. Client side apps. HTMX doesn't help much there, e.g. templating, or just plain JS code.
- 26 Nov 2024. CloudFlare workers can bundle any kind of files, including text, data, and WASM. [Docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#bundling)

- 26 Nov 2024. Here's a convenient pattern to `git commit` a directory but nothing else in it (e.g. a `build/` directory). Add a `.gitignore` file with `*` followed by `!.gitignore`. Only the `.gitignore` file is tracked.
- 23 Nov 2024. OpenAI lets you download GPT instructions and execute arbitrary code in their containerized environment. This is not a bug. [Ref](https://0din.ai/blog/prompt-injecting-your-way-to-shell-openai-s-containerized-chatgpt-environment)
- 23 Nov 2024. BM25 works as follows: [Ref](https://emschwartz.me/understanding-the-bm25-full-text-search-algorithm/)
  - For each query term in the query, sum up the product of:
    - Inverse document frequency = LN(% of docs without the query term + 1) -- with a small tweak
    - Term frequency = freq / (freq + k) -- where k is usually between 1.2 to 2. Returns 0-1 with diminishing frequency benefit
      - k is multiplied by Document length normalization = 1 - b(1- DocLength/AvgDocLength). Longer documents have larger k, dampening frequency benefits.
  - Some implications:
    - The actual BM25 score has no meaning. It's just useful for ordering
    - BM25 scores for 2 queries can be compared ONLY IF the document sets don't change

  - Belonging to multiple social worlds is a good way to defend against no longer being good at what you used to be. Diverse values and social groups help.
  - Self handicapping explains a lot about the world. You study late for a maths test - so you can fail for lack of trying, not aptitude. Ecosystems (e.g. sports teams) mitigate self-handicapping.
  - You don't have to be good in athletics to get the benefits. A slow runner gets the same discipline, pumping up, etc that a fast runner does
  - Mono cultures are good to accomplish a known mission. Diversity is good to pivot during uncertainty. So, localize mono cultures

  - This works particularly well for verifiable results (code, math, etc.)
  - Technique: Ask an LLM hundreds of times at low temperature and pick the most common one. (Google's Minerva used this on the MATH dataset.)
  - Better Technique: Ask an LLM hundreds of times. Pick the best solution based on an evaluation metric (reward model)

- Many arts demand devotion. Devoting unrestricted time is part of that. 16 hours of practice a day is not uncommon. Sessions don't start and end on time.
- Instruments take a lot longer to learn than vocal music. The instrument needs to become an extension of you.

How I write podcast. Paul Graham essays

- Write simply. It helps communicate. (Don't concise if communication worsens.). It forces you to make the idea better
- Do lame stuff. Else you won't start. Low standards drive creativity
- The more to delete, the better your writing. Read your piece. Highlight what feels poor. Fix it. Ask friends to highlight what's BORING? UNCONVINCING? Delete the first, brainstorm the second. Or ask, what's the 10% to cut and 10% to keep.
- Write about stuff you don't know above the. Writing GENERATES ideas
- Write about what's BUS. GENERAL and SURPRISING. (Laughter is a sign of comprehension.) Do HARD things to cultivate taste.
- Spend more time with people who generate ideas in you. Ravi chithappa. Ram. Ankor. Ganes. Books!
- Build taste. I have a taste for picking technologies. Data visualization. Retrospect. Write down what you like and dislike. Copy what you REALLY like. Guilty pleasures.
- A benefit of lower standards is that it let's you pick the path less travelled.
- ITERATE. Discuss ideas. Iterate. Acknowledge. ITERATE.

All in one podcast. Can Google save itself?

- the success of a developer platform is the number of people using it. But not everyone uses it equally. Some people create winning products which drives attention to the platform. Use llm proxy like that to measure weekly average users and cost saving through caching
- one week ago, if someone at Google stood up and said we have too many black people in our images, the responsible AI team would have shut them down calling them racist. They had too much power and it was a one-way conversation. With the backlash now, there is a lot more awareness and acceptance of the balance. Security is like that. It's too easy to empower and shut things down until there is a backlash

- how do you think about risk? Well, things do happen. It's as simple as that
- autonomy and decentralization helps derisk
- do more and more of what works. That's a powerful way of compounding
- long-term investments are better than frequent trading because you get to reinvest the tax you otherwise would have paid. So unless the alternative is super compelling, stay invested
- if you need to be the person who DOES the thing, you delegate less, leverage list, compound less, because you have to DO. BE A PERSON WHO SETS THE FIELD INSTEAD. The coach, the chess master, the director, patient strategist who Waits for the good hit

Raman Srinivasan

- IITM Profs and MTechs are spinning off deep tech startup.
  - Agnicool is an example. They 3D print rockets with ceramic composites from Germany
  - Sriram Krishnan (Facebook), Balaji Krishnan invested in pre-Series A
- Govt is de-regulating space tech and geospatial. Talking of de-regulating nuclear.
  - ISRO seems to be focusing on cutting edge while others are doing commercial stuff
  - There are about 100 space tech startups in India
  - You can build your own modular reactor
- Geospatial AI is a big opportunity
  - Have released a lot of 10m resolution geospatial data almost for free
- success is about getting NO factor wrong. Failiure just requires one aspect to fail. Brand, business savviness, financial stability, tech superiority, deep pockets, managing Gvt, long-term mindset, etc. - all of these matter. That's what made TCS monopolize the exam business in India.
- For deepening AI, we need, Talent, Data pipelines, Hardware
- Next wave is LMMs, not LLMs
- What's not captured in LLMs is verbal knowledge and tacit knowledge (in people's fingertips). India is rich in this. The road to tacit knowledge has to go through India
  - We can get a welder to train a simulator and pay the welder
  - We can get a storyteller to tell a few stories and train oral LLMs
- Tacit knowledge will have to cover robotics. Train robots to bring coffee in just 50 demos!
- "Project delays are within the 'rulebook'. Buyt paying skilled welders for ship building or nuclear pressure boilers needs breaking 100s of rules. Once they get certified, they abscond to Iran or somewhere."
- TCS Ignite started in 2006 by Ramadorai. Before recession. "There is going to be a talent shortage. Recruit from next rung. Science not engineering graduates. Break HR monopoly and corruption - colleges became placement agencies. Fewer people per college. Across the country. Train them."
  - Tried in 2000. HR refused. Business refused. When Chandra was identified, Ramadorai took it up himself as a challenge.
  - Ramadorai had very precise attention. Sat 7 am calls. "What are you doing?" 2 min call. Enough to energize.
  - Would exchange and ask for brief updates. He reads and responds. You get a decision in a few hours early in the morning. No decision bottleneck
  - He wanted to know ALL the details. Very precise, small, frequent probes on what's happening.
  - E.g. one 6 am, he called. "What are the lectures planned for today?" He expected I would know this. If not, next time I would be prepared.
  - He would call another person and ask the same question. So I updated the others.
  - I've never seen anyone with that bility to ground-truth.
  - He wants 10 birds from 1 stone. Get BSc, but don't comprimize. Get the best 2 per college but a full batch size of 500.
  - We became the biggest training program as a single batch -- with 500 people. He wanted to demonstrate scale.
  - HR and CFO said, 'You recruit first. Then we'll give you money. We don't think it's possible."
  - We had anchor colleges and brought people from other campuses.
  - We did digitized exams. Took big servers to the campus. Fully digitized with full auditability. Plugged the laptops into the college LANs. Kids had never used a mouse. We had to teach them. We said, "Don't worry. These are logical questions, not questions. We'll pay a full salary."
  - We learned that 1 out of 2 didn't even join. Many took up a Masters. They didn't want to join the workforce. Unless they're desperate economically. Even poor parents, if they can afford to support you at home, they do that. It's weird.
  - Every weekend, we visited a few campuses. 71 locations across the country.
    - Found the NSS college in Ottapalam (Kumbakonam of Kerala. Cultural centre.) College had a nice nice Math dept website. I said "Mr Ramadorai, this looks promising." One Sat morning, he called and said, "When are you going to Ottapalayam?"
    - We landed in the college. There was an impromptu communist student strike. We made 38 offers out of 100 who took the exam. Never had such a high conversion. One girl, whose father was a coolie, jad communication issues. Had a colleague talk in Malayalam. She was an amazing success. My colleague Murali made a documentary about her.
  - We started in July. By Dec, we had 500 joinees.
- No one is doing such a thing now.
  - You have to get dozens of things just right. Compromising on even one kills it.
  - Ramadorain loaded it with multiple objectives. Fresh talent. Low cast. Sustainable.
  - He kept pushing for innovation. I pushed back. But he was persistent. Over time, I came around and we started innovating.
  - We restructured training program around innovation. Like a YCombinator. That unleashed extraordinary energy. Several of the kids are running their own startups. Ramadorai was very supportive of that.
  - The assessment product came out of that.
  - First batch, everyone was very sceptical. We got a lot of pushback. They're dumb. Ethics issues. Communication issues. Lot of prejudice. So we got them to do internal recruitment till they were satisfied. An internal placement market. THEN reputation was set.
  - I told them, always stick to the dress code. One weaver's sone wore a bright yellow polyester T-shirt. I asked him why he didn't stick to the dress code. "Sir, it's my first T-shirt."
  - Ramadorai tracked how many became billable. We were unable to place 70. He said, give them 1 more month training. Then we placed 64 of the 70. He said "Do something about the 6. I want 100% placement." We absorbed them as a teaching assistant. One was a weaver's son. One was a PC's daughter. A mestri's son. A shopkeeper's daughter from North Madras. None could speak English. They learned to code and helped build the exam software, with Srikumar who was a brilliant Java coder. That gave us the confidence that these are good kids, just from the wrong part of town. With a good guide, they're very capable.
- We bought a bunch of Nintendo Wiis. Kids have to play.
  - He asked for a welding simulator. "Velu the Welder". The kids built it using the Wii.
  - We got the most accomplished welder spend an afternoon at Ignite. He ripped us apart. 4 hrs non-stop. He told us EVERY thing wrong with it. Blasted us.
  - I told Murali, "Let's call it a toy. It's not a simulator. Let kids play." He said, "I want to show that it can be done!"
  - Murali churned out rapid iterations in a frenzy.
  - Ramadorai said, "Deploy it in the field." So we went to all kinds of remote places like Gondiya below Nagpur. Surprisingly cosmopolatan. Junction of EW and NS train lines. We set up welding institutes in each. It was on the cloud. We could track everything.
- KPK killed the skills. Hard core bureaucrat. His view is colonial.
  - Ignite philosophy is about unleashing energy of people.
  - Colonoial model is about controlling people by keeping them poor. KPK and Chidambaram had that mindset.
  - Ramadorai brought him in as Secy of NSDC. he killed the policies
  - Modi did the first cut by creating a ministry. KPK ensured that it never gew. Like Yes Minister. Made sure nothing moved
  - Had Govt not changed, he would have been Secy Finance. He was seen as Chidambaram's blue eyed boy. People know he was associated with NSE scam. Ramadorai helped by bringing him into skills
  - He is very smart. Knows the IAS machinery in and out. Lives and breathes that. H
  - Ramadorai likes him though. Put him on board of Tata Consumers.
- NSE Scam. He's part of the cabal with Ajay Shah. Private trading firms could co-locate within NSE and could make a huge amount of money. KPK ran some of this by proxy to fund Congress. But he left no fingerprints. But everyone knows it is him. He was running Chitra Ramakrishnan by proxy. He was the Himalayan Yogi.
- Ignite continued with unwavering focus. Kept increasing the kind of focus. We had a 99.5% success rate in placements. Just a handful of failures.
- Ramadorai has written about Ignite in "The TCS Story". My Dad translated it in Tamil. It's not a typical business biography. Worth reading. Should be a mandatory course in MBA courses in India. So many lessons.
  - You have to read it knowing how Mr Ramadorai speaks. What is NOT said is just as important. Ch 5 is the thinnest - on the IPO. It is packed with so much stuff. Unless you know, you won't understand.
  - "Tatas got the Govt to change a tax law to make the IPO meaningful." Behind that, there's a lot. You have to be alert to catch the sentene. He won't brag, or talk about the significance of some of these.
  - Book is packed with dense insights. Unless you ARE LOOKING FOR IT, you'll miss it. Worth reading SEVERAL times. You need a foot-noting.
- Currently reading Pasquenelli -- Social History of Artificial Intelligence. Eye of the Master. Worth reading. I'm not Marxist by belief but they get some things right. Surprised how vibrant the European left is.
  - "If someone is doing manual work, there is tacit knowledge that automation captures."
- India doesn't need self-driving cars. But a farmer would like a gaming controller that ploughs his fields while he sits under a tree. Semi-intelligent machines that removes the burden of hard labour in the country.
- Once a year, for a few weeks, I do manual labour. People are under-nourished. People typically work 5 hours a day. Not enough muscle mass. So use them for what they're good at
- I've seen the power tools. When Chinese power tools became cheap, the power welding became much more efficient. Everyone has become a monkey with power tools. They charge per inch. They know how to leverage the tech for economic benefit. Just bring in the power tools and rapidly finish and make money. But there are sections that are still poor and haven't made the transition. How can we create pathways for them? How can AI help?
- Anand: Why not use a gimball. RS: Good idea.
- Role modern psychologist DW Winnicott on ChatGPT (like Socrates)
  - E.g. You don't need a perfect mother. A good enough mother is better
  - Similarly, why not a "good enough" Bharat mata than a perfect one?

Tangi

- Domain-specific models being beaten by general purpose models is a phase. It will reverse towards domain.
  - AI will potentially help build and understand domain-specific models
- Models are evolving so rapidly that humans cannot interpret models. We need a process to interpret models!
- xAI, Responsible AI, Physics-guided or Knowledge-guided models (called grey box models) are therefore a trend
- CS papers
  - Don't review other papers, certainly not other fields.
  - Disregard measurement errors.
- When CS papers get applied to climate, manufacturing or biology, we'll worry about
  - Interpretability
  - Domain-specific mechanics. (Introduce that into the training as a constraint.)
    - Many domain experts are using AI to UNDERSTAND their process. Need to explore
  - Uncertainty
- IB adds context to make learning applicable. But that distracts from the core learning, and if there's a gap it widens
- Most data science courses teach "Python science", not data science. They teach a bunch of models. They don't teach how even one kind of model e.g. LSTM works.
- Most coaching programs today teach FAMILIARITY with problems, not critical thinking
- Most of current education will become redundant thanks to LLMs. For students AND teachers
  - Coding will become irrelevant
  - Cognitive thinking, reasoning, human relations, systems thinking will become more relevant
  - Troubleshooting will become more important. AI is not self-diagnosing. I would hire someone who can figure out something is going wrong, diagnose what's going wrong, and fix it
  - #TODO Hire for troubleshooting ability. Give a Q, an A, and ask them to figure out if it's wrong, why, and fix it
- All my exams and quizzes are open book, open ChatGPT. Onus is on me to give a problem that forces you to think.
  - #TODO Write a question paper that is ChatGPT proof.
- Exploring AI could be a ToK subject. "How to interact with an AI?"
  - We need a manual on how to use AI. Like Simon Willison says
  - Content doesn't suffice. You need pedegogy. What to serve you at what time, how, how to assess. Lots of businesses are filling this gap
  - Students get great confidence when a teacher points to online content and says, I"ll tell you WHAT to see" and COMPLEMENTS that in their class
- "The map is not the territory." Most people confuse sample mean for the actual.
- #ASK Parameter estimation -> Signal estimation -> State estimation
- Stats vs DL differ in that
  - There is no notion of a defined "truth". Hence reliability is not measurable
  - Parameters have no value. Hence interpretability is ignored.
- #TODO Read 2020 National Education Policy. It's quite modern.
  - We need a manual on self-learning too
  - Listening is not learning. You know only if you implement.
  - Levels for students:
    - I can solve it.
    - I can explain why it works.
    - I can find alternatives.
    - I can apply it to a new area, reformulating (requires imagination.)
  - For teachers, you also need:
    - Responsible learning (extra careful about what to teach and how to teach, to exceite them, to teach at THEIR level).
    - Show the universality and connecting to other concepts. E.g. noise reduction with FT is like using water to remove dirt. Transform to water domain, remove dirt, transform back to air domain. It's better than dusting clothes to remove clothes. Washing machine programs are just different models of removing noise in the water domain.
- Teach people who WANT to learn **AND** who will APPLY it long-term. That's what maximizes impact
  - Grad students are more satisfying that way.
  - Else, it is WASTED effort. (Not that it's a bad thing for the student, but the effort _IS_ wasted for the teacher)
- Therefore, I believe students should have general engineering first, and let students pick specialization later. Some universitie are doing that.
- #THINK Students remember my philosophy more than my content. We impart character, not just knowledge.
- Astrology and horoscopes serve a different function. They provide explainability, not predictive ability. As the world becomes less explainable, the need for astrology will grow.
  - Explainability is about creating STORIES that fits data plausibly. It has nothing to do with data or truth.
  - Explainability and predictive ability and reproducibility are all different. Maybe, Science is about the latter two, less about explainability.
  - Astrology is a model. The map is not the territory. It's an explanatory, not a predictive model.
  - #THINK Therefore, my lessons are just explanations. Stats about experiments are STILL explanations. They are NOT reproducible or predictive. Hence not yet science
- The meaning of our life is the transformation we undergo in our lives
  - #TODO Read "The Journey of Souls" by Michael Newton. A hypnotherapist
- #TODO Try regression therapy / hypnosis. Record it and listen to it. Just for fun!

Rohini Deshpande

- Slam book was the Facebook of the 1900s
- Prepared mind is an extremely powerful tool for learning. Practice prepared mind
- When women drop out of education or career, that is also a waste from the teacher and system perspective
- The time for career growth is the same as child bearing time for women. That's not true for men. But child rearing can be done by either. That's not recognised. It's 0K for a man to raise the child and make the home and 0K to treat that as the default
- Since men are more senior, it's usually logical for them to stay in their jobs. That's a systematic bias. When seniors advise women to step back. they respect it. That widens the barrier. Why not eliminate that situation?
- Be proud of the working women in the family
- Stats are just a symptom. They don't explain the cause. (Map is not the territory.) Explanations are what really helps us fix the cause. Hence stories are important.

The hidden brain podcast. What would Socrates do?
Also Philosophy Bites Podcast: why do philosophers use example
And: the happiness lab: happiness lessons of the ancients

- How many of our beliefs are truly our own? How many are a product of our environment? Contrast these and identify your true beliefs
- For every thought and action you have, even tiny ones, ask "Why am I doing that?" Dig deeper because it may not be intrinsic
- One way to become memorable is to.write stuff others will reproduce for a long time. Plato and Aristotle did that
- everyone has multiple personality. This is partly because different parts of the brain evolved independently for different functions. System one and system two thinking are just such one broad classification. e.g. We think our train is moving when the nearby train moves because our visual brain is faster than our somatic brain.
- Good lessons and pitches cater to the rational AND the subconscious. Reason AND story. To activate different parts of the brain. That's why philosophers use examples
- Philosophy brings change through reason. Revelations: through sudden insight. Rhetoric: through insight.
- Act as if you already are what you want to become. Aristotle
- Align your environment (including habits) to your beliefs. It will become easier to act your beliefs then.
- All virtues are moderation. It's possible to take every virtue to the wrong extreme
- Some Christians have wristband that reads WWJD. What would Jesus do? Explore yourself a reminder of what would X do. Maybe Benjamin Franklin, Socrates, Feynman, etc
- People mistake their environment for their feelings. 1970s Experiment: People on a shaky bridge think they love each other. Experiment: people rationalize things irrespective of reality.
- "The Unexamined Life" is about questioning theories or stories or maps constantly. It's also about questioning our thoughts and emotions constantly. Mindfulness is the VERBAL way of doing this. Meditation is the NON-VERBAL way of paying attention. Both are Processes to remove distraction and increase authenticity.
- Learning about people is a good way to learn about ourselves. And vice versa.

Lez Friedman Podcast: Jeff Bezos

- Build stuff that is is ubiquitous that other people take it for granted. The initial idea needs to be that obvious and easy. Like one click purchase or customer reviews
- Build stuff that other people can build on. Internet makes startups possible. Infrastructure is about enabling others at scale
- Decision making approaches: single person decides on two way doors. Deliberate as a team on one way doors
- Conflict resolution: disagree and COMMIT. NO sniping, I told you so, malicious compliance. Avoid compromise. Avoid decision by attrition (most persistent wins).
- people are inherently biased towards hierarchy. So the senior most person should speak last
- we have a happiness bias. Contracted by choosing the unhappier options first
- the map is not the territory. The metric is not the objective. We need metrics. But make sure you know why
- see the world through the eyes of the customer. Use your own product. It's living their lives that makes customer obsession real. Jeff Bezos called their own customer care to see how long the actual wait time was. It was much longer than the metric reported
- How to prioritize. whatever problems customers will still face in 10 years are the big problems. These are worth putting time into because they are stable in time
- people working on big problems will never get down to the small problems. So have a dedicated team that works only on the paper cuts. It should be a dedicated team
- we co evolve with our tools. We build tools and then our tools change us. It reprograms our brains
- cut out 10 minutes to the beginning of each meeting for people to read the material. They never reread anyway. This makes the meetings more productive
- Powerpoint is designed for persuasion, not truth seeking. It is also easier for the author than for the reader. Prefer narratives that are focused on finding the truth and are easier for the audience though tougher for the author

16 Dec 2023

- grab. Improving last mile delivery in maps. When did people pick up the phone, when should driver be allocated to minimize waiting time, layer on top of OSM.
- Singapore developers the Sea Lion 7b model
- Try VLLM with AWQ format. Can do batch inferencing. Needs a good GPU
- Amex prediction whether they can pay back in 1 year or 18 months. That choice is a business decision. In real time. Precompute individual score and use it as input to another model. Model must be explainable by regulation. Creates decision tree models therefore. Compliance team must agree if I can use a feature. Can't use gender. Age (in US, Canada);- high age is more risk. Can't use edu level in the US.
- Capture information from camera and use LLMs. Like traffic cameras mapping. Explore GIS from video cameras
- grab tracks road closures and road accidents and whether a cycle can go on a road vs a bike vs a car
- all drivers have a front facing camera

Hidden Brain podcast. The secret to great teams

- lack of diversity means shared blind spots. Everyone will make the same mistake and therefore support the same wrong move
- red team and blue team practices, case study interviews, these are all great practices
- findings from Team IQ tests
- individual intelligence does not matter
- individual personality does not matter
- team cohesion does not matter. People may feel good about nice teams. People may feel good about productivity teams. But feeling good does not impact productivity
- gender diversity helps. More women than men is the best recipe
- video calls are more disruptive than audio calls. Some people tend to dominate. There is a lack of synchronization between video and audio emotions perhaps because people are distracted
- the social attentiveness of the weakest socially attentive member is an excellent predictor. They tend to drag the team down

Art works for teachers #podcast. Lateral thinking

- Practicing lateral thinking puzzles is actually a good way of learning lateral thinking. But don't be deductive. Try and guess the answer at one shot
- questioning assumptions helps. For example I questioned if the car the man pushed was real. It was a toy car in Monopoly
- I tend not to develop alternate hypotheses. For example I assumed that the man living on the 30th floor jumped into his balcony. He actually jumped out from the first floor window.
- Confirmation bias is insidious. When was the last time you changed your mind on a major belief?
- Be in uncomfortable places! introduce randomness. Random place. Random channel. Random Wikipedia page. Random word. Random picture. Oblique strategies.
- Humour is a universal good. Be more funny
- magic words to make a person like you. What I really like about you is ...
- Ask people for what you are good at first. THEN ask where to improve. They will open up
- leadership. Only do what only you can do. Very powerful

How to write #podcast. Steven Pressfield

- Every story needs a villain.
- Every story needs a femme fatale. The sea in Moby Dick. The rice fields in Seven Samurai. The desert in Lawrence of Arabia. The unsolved mystery that pulls you in
- it needs an all is lost moment. The low point mid way
- #todo "when divinity presents itself in front of us, we nail it to a cross." Lost opportunities
- #Todo saying no is about valuing what you do enough. Saying yes means you're not doing anything of value. discover the value in your work
- the chinese have a word for revenge bedtime procrastination full stop its when you don't like your work and come back at bed not sleeping and postpone your sleep
- practice subtraction or inversion. Always exclude things you should do less of
- Momentum is power in the early stages. When you find an obstacle, move around it even if it means losing 9 out of 10 tanks. Blitzkrieg strategy
- Copying practice is a very powerful learning technique. It is underrated
- reviewing your own code, blog, speeches is a highly underutilized way of improving. Having others review it helps even more
- Review writing from the perspective of a single specific person reading it. That perspective helps a lot
- Explore prayer. It has power but I am blind to it

- #PODCAST Todd Herman: Unleashing Your Secret Identity (The Knowledge Project with Shane Parrish)
  - The most common bias is overconfidence.
  - The most common error is not researching before starting.
  - 90% of success is your environment. (The position.) People who coach mentor you are critical. Learn from the best.
  - Hope can be limiting. We hold on to its comfort and don't act. Fear can be limiting.
  - But courage to reach the goal can be overwhelming. Prefer the courage to figure it out
  - The goals our current selves set are limited by our current selves' vision. Be less blind and be open to external and impossible goals
  - Practice is a form of compounding. When we practice despite adversity, we learn how to handle adversity. Same with serendipity.
  - identities are a map to our territory. We get territorial about it and that is called ego!
  - Identities are not set in store. Switching identities helps. To solve hard problems, QUICKLY switch identity and QUICKLY solve them. Micro identity shifts are common.
  - Rituals help change identities. Attire helps too. Even a pair of glasses. Or a hat.
  - Give people a small.ritual.to.tamsform.identiries
- Manik Bhandari of Vulcan.ai: Uses CV to detect oil content in videos of palms. Intel helped find a rugged computer vendor. Found a Chinese camera vendor at 1/10th the price. Live feeds and monitors help leadership get a feel for live ops. Pricing is annual per system in each plant. Since it directly saves cost, high price is not a problem at all. Team of 12 software people - zero attrition. Have an investor. One CTO.
- Manik Bhandari also uses offline accelerometers to evaluate the effectiveness of fertilizer spreading. Client spends $300 mn on fertilizer. Efficiency improvement of 30% on that is huge.

- USCS had duplicate customer names. ABC foods with the East Door facing one street, and ABC Foods with the North Door facicing another street. Logistics providers charge per stop. So when delivering to this customer, they got charged twice often. 25% of customers were duplicated.
- "As an evaluator, GPT-4 has been shown to adequately correlate to human judgments (Fu et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023a), even potentially outperforming crowd-sourced workers on some annotation tasks (Gilardi et al., 2023)".

- Sayan. Change in tech stacks gets overwhelming rather than focused on solving problems. Interested in back end than front end. Built a CGPA calculator.
- Improvements. need a good instructor. Stats 2 Andrew and Python Sudarshan Iyengar are the best. Madhavan for PDS and Java. System Commands too Gandham Phanikimar. Arun Rajkumar MLT is universally loved. They are expert teachers. It's fine in TDS. Tutorials need to be good quality. Like MLT and System Commands - video and audio clarity, content clarity, interactive and not monotonous with questioning. It's good to be practical. PEOPLE feel tools are used and not taught. Course is fun and interactive but should be 4 credits given projects. RoE and project questions are about doing stuff not theory and is useful. Maybe introduce a project - taken during or after course. Can take an entire term. Like BDM, MAD.

- humans evolved in high stress environments. They had dangers and had to rely on each other for support. Today, in the absence of danger, humans seek stimulation. That could be gambling addiction, shopping, social likes, whatever. Let's give people danger and stimulation safely
- Status determined survival in the past. They got more food. That's why we are status conscious. Exposure to people with higher status makes us feel bad. There are many dimensions of status and each can make people good or bad.

CeV

- Chain: generate multiple responses and ask the LLM to synthesize. Khanmigo generates multiple alternate responses to students questions. Then if the response is different from the students answer, it shares its answer but then ask students to explain their reasoning. That gives the LLM a lot more input
- ChatGPT gives answers. Khanmigo asked what you know, then asks you to try something out. Then shares feedback
- LLMs need memory to learn from content. That's the next big thing
- AutoGPT can write it's own code and heal itself. Existing use cases: sales prospecting, product research articles, prepare podcast, shoe market research. BabyAGI, TeenageAGI etc are evolving

- Sal Khan uses a second AI to monitor whether the AI tutor is going shady
- LLM Blender synthesizes across LLMs
- Having one LLM validate another can be very effective. Or the same LLM (clarification)

26 Sep 2023

- Sal Khan uses ChatGPT to generate questions on a subject.
- RAG is actually quite ineffective. Tends to get to 80% Ok and stops. Improving the docs by restructuring is the #1 step here. Research ensemble retrieval (keyword vs embedding vs query:). Research chunk size. Research base prompts. Metadata filters help a lot - dates and other similarities. Research ensemble special purpose indices. Research re-ranking. Research query transformations - rephrasing, HyDE, sub-queries. Research fins-tuning. Research tools. #share [via](https://towardsdatascience.com/10-ways-to-improve-the-performance-of-retrieval-augmented-generation-systems-5fa2cee7cd5c)

- Chain of thought prompting. Ask LLMs to write a plan. Then execute against it step by step. Or give it a plan and execute step by step. Or a set of examples of executing step by step.
- Water balance. Archimedes didn't measure volume displaced. That's too hard. Galileo feels he balanced the crown against an equal gold weight and immersed the entire balance in water. An impure crown would tilt the balance.

- Flexibility permits mistakes. At Pixar, in the early stages of graphics, they could configure a light with any properties. That led them to create several unnatural lightings. Now, lights reflect real lights better. Allowing artistes rather than coders to do stuff
- "What are the rules you're following that you're not even aware of?"
- "Hopefully, a lot of that is not tedious anymore. And that opens up different stories in different words." That's how the economics of optimization works.
- External shocks enable impossible changes. Chicago found it politically hard to increase parking prices. They privatized it to Morgan Stanley, losing a lot of flexibility and control (e.g. over Sunday Parking, green walkways) but improved parking and traffic dramatically.
- A GAN approach is a good way to reduce Gen AI hallucination. Ask it to critique itself
- Cost is the least of people's concerns when it comes Gen AI spending
