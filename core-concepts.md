> ... seemingly impenetrable topics are less intimidating if you know there are only a dozen concepts to learn.
> And often the details of a subject are unimportant if you know the big concepts.

  - **Lifecycle validation** – Plan → specify → build/configure → verify/qualify → release → operate/maintain → retire; evidence at every step.
  - **Risk‑based approach** – Focus validation effort where failure impacts product quality, patient safety, or data integrity most.
  - **Documented evidence & traceability** – Link user requirements → functional/spec docs → test cases/results; auditors must see the chain.
  - **Data integrity (ALCOA+)** – Data must be Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate—plus Complete, Consistent, Enduring, Available.
  - **Change control & configuration management** – Every change is assessed for risk, approved, tested, and documented before release.
  - **Supplier / service provider qualification** – Assess vendors (SaaS, cloud, integrators) and maintain quality agreements; you retain regulatory responsibility.
  - **Qualification phases (IQ/OQ/PQ)** – Prove correct installation, operation against specs, and performance in the real process.
  - **Validation Master Plan (VMP) & system-level plans/reports** – Define scope, approach, roles, deliverables; close with a report justifying the release decision.
  - **Security, access control, audit trails, e‑signatures** – Ensure only authorised actions, full traceability, and Part 11/Annex 11 compliant records.
  - **Periodic review & continuous monitoring** – Re-evaluate systems, data integrity, and risk; ensure backups, disaster recovery, and business continuity work.
  - **Deviation/CAPA management** – Record incidents, investigate root causes, implement corrective and preventive actions.
  - **Training & SOPs** – People running and maintaining the system need role-appropriate training and controlled procedures.
